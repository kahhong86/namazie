							<h1 class="title-heading"><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> showcase</h1>
							<p>
								We work with clients across many industries to realise, protect and commercialise their Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
							</p>
							<p>
								We recognize the efforts that our clients put in to develop their IPR and are committed to work with them to leverage on their intangible intellectual property assets to achieve tangible business growth.
							</p>
							<p>
							IPR include <strong>copyrights, design rights, patents and trademarks</strong>. In this section, we explain briefly what each of these rights protect, and we showcase some of the IPR which we have assisted our clients to protect. </p>
							<h2 class="title-eyebrow">COPYRIGHT showcase</h2>
							<p>
								Copyright protects the expression of ideas. Works such as literary works, dramatic works, musical works, artistic works, published works, sound recordings, films, television and radio broadcasts, cable programmes, and performances can be protected by copyright law. Generally, the owners of the copyrighted works have the right to reproduce, publish, perform and communicate the works to the public.
							</p>
							<p>
								Copyright owners can also prevent the unauthorised use of their works if it is reproduced without the owners’ consent or license. In Singapore, there is no system to file for registration of copyright. A piece of original work enjoys copyright protection as soon as once the author expresses the work in a tangible form. We advise our clients on the protection and enforcement of their copyrighted works in Singapore.
							</p>
							<p>
								Paintings are copyrighted works. Here are some images of the paintings by Taiwanese artist, Ms Su-Yi Weng.</p>
							</p>
							<h2 class="title-eyebrow">Patents Showcase</h2>
							<p>
								A patent can be obtained for novel inventions. Patents can cover mechanical, chemical or electronic inventions. Even a new method of performing a series of actions, or conducting business, is potentially patentable. One such patent was obtained by an accomplished musician who secured a patent for a “System and Method for Facilitating Learning of a Musical Instrument”. This novel methodology teaches us to play a musical instrument even without a musical background and without the instruction of a music teacher. By merely following the patented methodology for music learning re-defined (patent pending in the USA, UK and Australia), a student can potentially play and record a musical piece. The methodology is available in an online platform that facilitates the learning of a musical instrument such as the piano, guitar etc. The Inventor, Samana Holdings Pte Ltd, is a Singapore company.
							</p>
							<p>
								Please visit Samana’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ClickSangeet/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> for your first lesson.
							</p>
							<h2 class="title-eyebrow">Designs Showcase</h2>
							<p>
								A design refers to the features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament as applied to an article and its registration confers protection to the external appearance of a product. Novel designs can be protected in Singapore by registration. The registration process is relatively inexpensive and easily processed, if the basic requirements are met. We assist our clients in registering their designs in Singapore to ensure that their designs are not copied by others. This enables a registered design owner to secure a competitive advantage over other products in a densely competitive market. Unique and stylish designs are often used to differentiate the external appearance of a product, such as a perfume or beverage bottle, or the shape of a car, a phone, or even ordinary household products, so as to attract the consumer by offering a distinct and aesthetically pleasing design.
							</p>
							<h2 class="title-eyebrow">Trademarks Showcase</h2>
							<p>
							<strong>Brands can be protected by securing a trademark registration.</strong> A trademark registration ensures that the owner of the registration is protected against the unauthorised use of identical or similar brands by another party. We advise clients on the selection of their brands, by conducting pre-filing trademark searches to assess a brand’s availability and suitability. A trademark application may then be filed to secure registration. A trademark registration is valid for 10 years, if used correctly, and is renewable for further periods of 10 years. A registered trademark enjoys more legal protection than un-registered marks under the Trade Marks Act. </p>
							<p>
								Here are some successful brands which are registered as trademarks in Singapore:
